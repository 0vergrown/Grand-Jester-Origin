# ðŸŽ­ Grand Jester Origin ðŸŽ­

**This Pack Adds:**
- Custom Origin

**Origin Detail:**

**Icon**: Player Head\
**Impact**: ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´\
**Description**: Once hailed as 'The Best Jester' in all the lands, you've returned with even more cunning and flair. As the Grand Jester, wield your wits and whimsy to manipulate, dazzle, and outsmart. With an arsenal of jests and tricks upgraded for a new era, prove again why your blend of humor and guile is unmatched.

*Positive* ðŸŸ¢:
- **Mockery of Monarchs**: Mock hostile mobs, causing them to become confused and attack each other. (Primary)
- **Spectral Summon**: Summon a ghostly audience that distracts all nearby enemies while you disappear for a short time. (Secondary)
- **Darting Quip**: With a flick of the wrist and a sharp eye, unleash your hidden talent for hurling darts. No bow needed, just your innate jesters' agility to launch arrows straight at your foes. (Attack)
- **Cap and Bells**: Wear a Jester's Hat and be granted agility boosts and reduced fall damage.
- **Artisan's Jest**: Craft the Marotte, a symbol of wit and mischief.
- **Tailor's Mirth**: Craft the vibrant Patchwork Cloak, blending color and mystery into every thread.

*Neutral* ðŸŸ¡:
- **Jester's Guise**: Alter your stature at will, shifting between your full height, a more compact form of one and a half blocks, and a discreet one block tall. (Save Toolbar Activator = Grow) or (Load Toolbar Activator = Shrink)
- **Fool's Escape**: Gain a speed burst when health is low, allowing you to escape danger.
- **Show Stopper**: When you die, rainbow fireworks go off damaging people around you.

*Negative* ðŸ”´:
- **Not Taken Seriously**: As a notorious jester, your flair for amusement often overshadows your intent. Villagers won't do trades with you and animals shy away, unsure if your gestures are genuine or just another jest.
- **Laughter's Fatigue**: You get hungry faster.
- **Overwhelming Jest**: Hostile mobs have a small chance of becoming enraged (getting a brief Strength boost) if mocked too frequently.
- **Misstep of Mirth**: Occasionally, when attempting to jump, you might "trip" and get a brief slowness effect.
